# 🦅 Kestrel  
**Navigate and Manage Your Data Operations with Precision and Speed**

Kestrel is a desktop application designed to streamline and simplify the daily tasks of DataOps engineers. Born from real-world data engineering experiences, Kestrel aims to provide a unified interface for common operational needs—from infrastructure visualization to deployment automation.

---

## 🌟 Overview

In today's data-driven environments, Data Operations (DataOps) engineers juggle numerous tasks to ensure data pipelines are efficient, reliable, and scalable.  
Kestrel addresses common pain points by offering templated solutions and intuitive visualizations for complex data ecosystems. Our goal is to empower DataOps teams by reducing manual effort, improving visibility, and accelerating operational workflows.

This project was initially conceived to support internal team needs but aims to grow into a versatile tool for the broader DataOps community.

## ✨ Key Features

Kestrel aims to provide a suite of tools to assist DataOps engineers. Here are some of the core features currently planned or in development:

### 🔍 Interactive Infrastructure Visualization
- **Bubble Diagrams:** Visualize your databases and tables as interactive bubble diagrams.
- **Drill-Down Capabilities:** Click on elements to get detailed information, helping identify space consumption, dependencies, and potential optimization targets.

### ⚙️ Deployment Automation (via Ansible Integration)
- **Templated Deployments:** Simplify the deployment of common data tools like Apache Airflow in cluster mode using an intuitive UI backed by Ansible playbooks.
- **Configuration Management:** Manage and version control your deployment configurations.

### 📊 Operational Dashboards *(Future)*
- Centralized view of key metrics and system health.
- Log aggregation and searching capabilities.

### 📁 Task Templating
- Create and reuse templates for common operational tasks.

### 🧩 Extensibility *(Future)*
- Plugin architecture to support a wider range of data sources and tools.
